Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) yada yada 

Scintillation is one observable that allows us to infer the emission size of their origin. This lets (if we are lucky) to disqinqish between the emission models of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). See MIT paper that constrained this for a (apparently) one off burst. This project will look at repeating FRBs using CHIME data

  <summary><strong>Tasks:</strong></summary>

### Completed:

### In Progress:
-  **Literature Review 1**
	- [ ] Review key papers on Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), with a focus on scintillation
- **Documentation**
	- [ ] Organize! Update the github readme with the big picture outline after reading a few papers
	- [ ] Start the Table of Contents Section, add license, and a figure showing CHIME, and scintillation
	- [ ] Learn google calender, and make note of important meetings
	- [ ] init a conda env with a corresponding `.yml` file for reproducibililty
